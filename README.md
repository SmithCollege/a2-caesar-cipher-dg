## Reflection Questions

What was your favorite part of this assignment?
    My favorite part of the assignment was having those 'a-ha' moments where I figure out the solution and finding out that it works.

What was most challenging about this assignment?
    The most challenging part (and at the same time, most helpful) of the assignment was the tests. At first I couldn't get them to work, then I realized they weren't working because I needed to make a get() method that they were calling. Then, another time the tests wouldn't show up, so I had to keep running things until they showed up. Finally, just testing my code and seeing it isn't working how I thought it would was difficult but very helpful compared to manually checking everything.   

General comments on your experience with this assignment:
    This assignment required me to think a lot, but once I figured out most of what I was supposed to do, it wasn't too much so.
    Some parts were unclear in the instructions - I didn't realize I needed to make get() or findIndex() until later.
